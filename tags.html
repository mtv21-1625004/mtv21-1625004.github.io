		<h2>About Me</h2>
		<p>I was born and raised in Seattle. I've just been here my whole life, so I've never got experienced with moving around--new school, home, environment,or anything like that.
		I'm a senior majoring in Public Health at UW and am still exploring different career pathways within Public Health.</p>
		<p> I like to hike, eat, and explore downtown in my free time.<p/>
